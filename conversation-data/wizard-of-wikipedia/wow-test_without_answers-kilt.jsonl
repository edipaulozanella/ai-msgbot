I've never read Harry Potter though. Who writes the books for him again? I forget\nJ.K. Rowling, she's real famous in america, although it's highly debated whether there are occult or religious connotations to her works\nOh really? That's pretty interesting. When did Rowling start the series? I've heard of the series since I was in elementary. Has to have been a long time.\nThe first one released in June of 1997, seems like it was yesterday, that's so crazy. They were the talk of recess at my school as a child. Every kid wanted them for their birthday.\nThat's a pretty long time! I recall kids constantly wanting to read them in elementary. Have you ever watched the movies for the series?\nI've seen a good number of them, but I am horrible with continuity so I never did finish them. Do you like The Beatles? Sir James Paul McCartney is one of my idols.\nI never watched a single one. I personally don't make it a point to listen to them, but they had some pretty decent songs.

He does well replacing the guy in AC/DC. I like the album Appetite For Destruction best.\nI really like the old AC/DC stuff with Bon Scott. I haven't heard Axl's take on it yet though, I should probably give it a listen to see if it holds up.\nThe first song I ever learned to play on guitar was \"Patience\" from the Lies album.\nI'm not much of a guitarist, but my brother is. He is a big fan of the blues style of AC/DC because it lends itself well to swing dancing (his other musical hobby).\nRight. I was formally trained for about a year, enough to give me a basic knowledge of playing. And I used to sing along with Axl too, my first experience with singing\nI've never been so musically talented, but I'm interested in the transition from Blues to Rock and Roll. \nA lot of rock music has it's roots in blues music progressions."}

It sounds like you have the metaphorical \"broken heart\"... with all that intense emotional, maybe even physical, stress and pain you're probably feeling.\nIt just hurts so much!  Why did he have to break my heart?  Metaphorically or otherwise!  Will I ever get over it?\nIt what makes you a part of the human race, having those feelings.. it's a cross-cultural concept that's been around for at least 3,000 years when talking about losing someone you desire, or who you loved. Time heals all wounds, as they say. But there is such a thing as \"broken heart syndrome,\" where physical damage happens to the heart. You should monitor yourself closely if you don't start feeling better with time.\nI couldn't even go to work today, I am so stressed! I hate him!!  I know that time will help, but right now I am so miserable!\nWell.. take some positive stock in what you're feeling. That emotional pain you're feeling from your broken heart--not only is it natural, but it's believed to be part of the survival instinct. Your body wants you to maintain your close social relationships, and you feel pain when they're lost. It's classic \"social-attachment system\" theory. You're human!\nWell I'm glad I'm human, but my jerk boyfriend sure isn't! \nHaha. Good point. Well, like I've been trying to say, it's a universal concept, and many cultures use the same word to describe the physical pain and feelings that come with their relationship loss. Throughout time, they made it through okay, and I'm sure you will, too.\nYeah, you're probably right.  He just better not be seeing someone else!"}

It's a protected national monument.\nThose are the best.  I'm really happy that people try to protect parts of nature, I'm always worried it'll all disappear someday."}

Why did he have to break my heart?  Metaphorically or otherwise!  Will I ever get over it?\nIt what makes you a part of the human race, having those feelings.. it's a cross-cultural concept that's been around for at least 3,000 years when talking about losing someone you desire, or who you loved. Time heals all wounds, as they say. But there is such a thing as \"broken heart syndrome,\" where physical damage happens to the heart. You should monitor yourself closely if you don't start feeling better with time.\nI couldn't even go to work today, I am so stressed! I hate him!!  I know that time will help, but right now I am so miserable!\nWell.. take some positive stock in what you're feeling. That emotional pain you're feeling from your broken heart--not only is it natural, but it's believed to be part of the survival instinct. Your body wants you to maintain your close social relationships, and you feel pain when they're lost. It's classic \"social-attachment system\" theory. You're human!\nWell I'm glad I'm human, but my jerk boyfriend sure isn't! "}

I've recently gotten into American football, but I think you're talking about soccer? Is that right?\nYeah, association football. Sorry, I should have specified! He's someone that started way back in 1994. He had good form all the way throughout, and that led him to get an international call-up in 1998, leading him to get signed for the Serie A defending champions, Juventus.\nOh okay! I couldn't recall the name association football! Thierry Henry sounds like quite an amazing player! Is he still playing?\nNo.. in fact, he's a French association football coach now! And he was--in both 2003 and 2004, he as the runner-up for FIFA World Player of the Year, so that gives you an idea of his skill. Also won two league titles and three FA Cups. Partly why I like him is I'm part French, and he represented us well at the international level, and is our leading goalscorer, too.\nHoly moly! He's very accomplished! I bet he makes for a fantastic coach!\nI agree with you.. He was mentored by the great Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who made him somewhat of a prolific striker (which is someone whose primary mission is to score), and so that set him up to be able to be Arsenal's all-time leading scorer with 228 goals in all the competitions he played in.\nThat's an impressive number! I'll bet many players look up to him. What else can you tell me about Thierry Henry?"}

I didn't realize it had roots in the UK!  Pro football started here in America though, right?\nWell the first match of american football was played november 1869 between two college teams under rules of the association of football, so i can say america has been pretty serious about football for a while but i am not sure about pro football starting here.Canda has a professional football team as well.\nOh.

Is it hard?\nIts not hard at all most people I know do it mainly as a competitive sport and some do it for recreation. \nDo you use a compound bow for hunting or a regular bow?\nI use a compound bow because of its rigidity, It makes the compound bow more energy-efficient than any other bows, it easier too because a lot less energy is dissipated in limb movement.\nOh, I see!  How much does a good compound bow cost?\nWell if you want a good one itll cost you a good $500 or more, Dont cheap out though because the cheaper ones break easy and can seriously injure you. \nYeah, a break sounds really dangerous.  When was archery invented?"}
